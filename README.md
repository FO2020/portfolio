## Programming Experience

I possess extensive proficiency in various programming languages and tools, such as Python, MATLAB, R, SQL, Excel, Geogebra, Spiss, and Julia. Throughout my academic journey, I extensively employed Python and MATLAB, completing specialized courses in data science and machine learning at the University of Bergen. Further enhancing my skill set, I undertook a comprehensive course in SQL and data modeling at UIB in Norway. My primary interests revolve around artificial intelligence, data science, and mathematics. I find immense beauty in analyzing data, extracting insights, and addressing societal issues through a mathematical lens. The process of mathematical modeling captivates me, offering a powerful means to explain diverse phenomena in our world. For me, the synergy between mathematics and programming is unparalleled; it forms the ideal combination to unravel complexities and gain a profound understanding of our surroundings.

## Interests

My interests encompass a diverse array of activities and fields. I have a passion for photography, particularly street and macro photography, capturing both moments and intricate details. Nature photography holds a special place in my heart due to the vibrant colors and beauty found in the natural world. Alongside my photographic pursuits, I find joy in outdoor activities such as hiking, swimming, and cycling, immersing myself in the wonders of nature. Additionally, I have a keen interest in watching films and exploring the fascinating realms of psychology and sexology.

## Languages

I am proficient in several languages, namely:
- English
- Norwegian
- Kurdish
- Arabic

Learning a new language goes beyond acquiring words and sentences; it opens doors to a new culture, diverse ways of expressing oneself, discovering new cuisines, and finding opportunities for laughter through jokes that are unique to each language. Embracing a new language is a gateway to a richer understanding of the world and its nuances.
